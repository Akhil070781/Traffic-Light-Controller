# Traffic-Light-Controller
Designed a Verilog-based controller for a four-way traffic intersection. The system allows traffic flow from one direction at a time, with a cycle of 30 seconds for green, 5 seconds for yellow, and red for the other directions. Ensured efficient traffic regulation and safety.
